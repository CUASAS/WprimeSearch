\section{Systematic Uncertainties}

The systematic uncertanties affecting the data vs. simulation correction factors
for the efficiencies of the lepton trigger and identification. The lepton
efficiencies are determined by the tag-and-probe method \cite{tagandprobe} for data as well as for
simulation. The systematic uncertainty is then given by the uncertainty of
the ratio of the efficiencies.

There are two kinds of systematic uncertainties: those that relay on shape-based
uncertainties and log-normal uncertainties that depend only on rate.

Lepton identification, HLT systematics,
pileup reweighting, and k-factors systematics are evaluated by
moving up and down the appropiate scale factor by its uncertainty.
(see section \ref{CorrectionsOnMC}).

A log-normal uncertainty of $1.8\%$ is included due to the measurement of
the integrated luminosity.

Uncertainties from higher order contributions, have been applied
to the Drell-Yan samples by evaluating up and down the QCD
and EWK uncertainties in the k-Factors.
